/**
 * The four floating icon cards.
 *
 * MOBILE PERFORMANCE (max-sm, i.e. below 640px — desktop is untouched):
 * `backdrop-blur-xl` is dropped and the translucent fill is made a little
 * more opaque instead.
 *
 * These cards sit directly on top of the orbit shells, which rotate
 * continuously, so each card's backdrop-filter had to re-sample and
 * re-blur its backdrop on every frame — four full backdrop re-blurs per
 * frame for as long as the Hero is on screen. Removing that is real work
 * saved on the GPU.
 *
 * Measured honestly, though, it is NOT what caps the mobile frame rate:
 * an interleaved A/B at a mobile-equivalent CPU (4x throttle) moved Home
 * from 3.7fps to 4.0fps — inside the run-to-run noise. What actually
 * dominates is the sheer NUMBER of elements Framer animates per frame in
 * the Hero (~20: five rings x two orbit layers, six comets, four cards,
 * plus the mark's own loops); style recalculation alone is ~1245ms of a
 * 2924ms budget, and it drops to ~446ms when the whole block is removed.
 * Reducing that element count is the lever that would move Home; this
 * change is not a substitute for it.
 *
 * The compensation stays on the SAME white wash the desktop card uses,
 * just doubled (0.05 -> 0.10). That matters: blurring the backdrop and
 * laying 5% white over it makes the card read slightly *lighter* than its
 * surroundings, so swapping in a dark fill would invert that relationship
 * and the cards would read as dark holes instead of glass. Everything else
 * — size, position, border, shadow, icon, float animation — is untouched.
