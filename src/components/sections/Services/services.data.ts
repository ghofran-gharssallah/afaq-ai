/**
 * Services shown in the Services section.
 *
 * Order is meaningful: the list runs from the most concrete, most-requested
 * offering (automation) through to the most advisory (consulting), so the grid
 * reads top-left to bottom-right as a descending ladder of commitment.
 *
 * NOTE ON THE FILENAME: this is `services.data.ts`, not `services.ts`. On a
 * case-insensitive filesystem (Windows/macOS) `services.ts` and `Services.tsx`
 * collide — TypeScript resolves `./Services/Services` by trying `.ts` before
 * `.tsx`, so the barrel import in App.tsx would silently resolve to this data
 * module instead of the component and fail with "has no default export".
