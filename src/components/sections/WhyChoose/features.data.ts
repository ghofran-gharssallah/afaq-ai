 * The six advantages, plus the stat band.
 *
 * `tier` drives the editorial rhythm: one feature block, two medium blocks and
 * three compact rows. Presentation is data-driven rather than hard-coded per
 * card, so re-ordering or re-weighting the section is a data change.
 *
 * Named features.data.ts to match technologies/services/team, and because a
 * bare features.ts would shadow a future Features.tsx on a case-insensitive
 * filesystem (TypeScript resolves .ts before .tsx).
