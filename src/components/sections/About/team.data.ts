/**
 * Team data for the About section.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PHOTOS
 *
 * `photo` is intentionally optional. When it is absent the card and modal
 * fall back to a monogram tile in the same glass language, so the section is
 * complete and premium without artwork. Nothing else has to change when one
 * is added — every layout is already sized for it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * COPY — every bio, skill and highlight below is taken from the wording on
 * the team cards supplied for this build. Nothing about anyone's history,
 * tenure or credentials has been invented. Please review before shipping.
 *
 * LINKEDIN — left empty deliberately. The LinkedIn button renders only when a
 * URL is present, so it will simply appear once these are filled in.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
